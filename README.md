# Text Manipulation Library - cText

**cText** is a library written in C language with a focus on text manipulation (strings) using methods whose use is similar to object-oriented programming using structures.

The present tool was built from the existing libraries in the C language: `stdio`, `stdlib`, `string` and `ctype`. Therefore, its limitations can affect the functioning of the library.
